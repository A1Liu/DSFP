## Task
1. Find a breadth-first algorithm that finds the equilibrium values of *r* and *v* for the entire network, given only the edges between nodes and their weights
2. Find a breadth-first algorithm that updates the values of *r* and *v* so that the only nodes that are updated are those that must be for the value of *r* to stay within .1 of the actual equilibrium value of *r* for each node

## Solution

Beats me.
