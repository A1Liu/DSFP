# Plan for the Network

## General Rules for Network

1. The network is a directed graph of nodes that hold 2 values: an integer *r*<sub>*n*</sub> from 1 to 5 inclusive, and a real number *v* > 0
2. All edges between nodes are weighted 1 to 5 inclusive
3. All nodes have an edge directed at itself with a weight of 1
4. The value of *r* for each node
